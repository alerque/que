# This code does almost exactly what the native VCSH sanity checking code
# does except that on finding a potential merge conflict, it moves the 
# extant object out of the way temporarily. The merge then happens cleanly
# as far as git knows, and a post-merge hook can figure out what to do with
# the extant versions of the objects.
